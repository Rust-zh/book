We would like to thank everyone who has worked on
the Rust language for creating an amazing language
worth writing a book about. We’re grateful to everyone
in the Rust community for being welcoming and creating
an environment worth welcoming more folks into.

We’re especially thankful for everyone who read early versions of
this book online and provided feedback, bug reports, and pull requests.
Special thanks to Eduard-Mihai Burtescu and Alex Crichton for providing
technical review and Karen Rustad Tölva for the cover art. Thank
you to our team at No Starch, including Bill Pollock, Liz Chadwick, and
Janelle Ludowise, for improving this book and bringing it to print.

Steve would like to thank Carol for being an amazing co-author.
Without her, this book would have been of much lesser quality and taken
a lot more time. Additional thanks to Ashley Williams, who provided an
incredible amount of support in the beginning, in the middle, and in the
end <3.

Carol would like to thank Steve for piquing her interest in Rust and for
the opportunity to work on this book. She’s grateful to her family for their
constant love and support, especially her husband Jake Goulding and her
daughter Vivian.
