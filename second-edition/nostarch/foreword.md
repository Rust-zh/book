# 前言

<!--
It wasn’t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally
about *empowerment*: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust
empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of
domains than you did before.
-->

虽然并不是很明显，不过 Rust 编程语言的本质在于*赋能（empowerment）*：无论你正在编写何种代码，Rust 都能让你如虎添翼，在更为广泛的领域中走得更远，写出自信。

<!--
Take, for example, “systems-level” work that deals with low-level details of
memory management, data representation, and concurrency. Traditionally, this
realm of programming is seen as arcane, accessible only to a select few who
have devoted the necessary years learning to avoid its infamous pitfalls. And
even those who practice it do so with caution, lest their code be open to
exploits, crashes, or corruption.
-->

例如，“系统层面”的工作涉及内存管理、数据表示和并发等底层的细节。传统上来说，这是个神秘的编程领域，只为浸淫多年的极少人所触及，也只有他们能避开那些臭名昭著的陷阱。即便是谨慎的实践者，亦唯恐代码出现漏洞、崩溃或损坏。

<!--
Rust breaks down these barriers by eliminating the old pitfalls and providing a
friendly, polished set of tools to help you along the way. Programmers who need
to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on
the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn
the fine points of a fickle toolchain. Better yet, the language is designed to
guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed
and memory usage.
-->

Rust 打破了这些障碍，它消除了旧有的陷阱，提供了友好、精良的工具伴你一路同行。想要深入底层控制的程序员也可以使用 Rust，无需冒着常见的崩溃或安全漏洞的风险，也无需跟进多变的工具链。其语言本身更是被设计为能够自然地引导你编写出在运行速度和内存使用上都十分高效的可靠代码。

<!--
Programmers who are already working with low-level code can use Rust to raise
their ambitions. For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively
low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you. And
you can tackle more aggressive optimizations in your code with the confidence
that you won’t accidentally introduce crashes or exploits.
-->

已经在从事编写底层代码的程序员可以使用 Rust 来提升抱负。例如，在 Rust 中引入并行是相对低风险的操作：编译器会为你捕获经典的错误。你还可以自信地采取更为激进的优化，而不会意外地引入崩溃或漏洞。

<!--
But Rust isn’t limited to low-level systems programming. It’s expressive and
ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of code
quite pleasant to write — you’ll find simple examples of both later in the
book. Working with Rust allows you to build skills that transfer from one
domain to another; you can learn Rust by writing a web app, then apply those
same skills to target your Raspberry Pi.
-->

不过，Rust 并不仅限于底层系统编程。其表现力和工效足以令人愉悦地编写出 CLI 应用、Web 服务器和很多其它类型的代码 —— 在本书中你会看到两个简单的示例。使用 Rust 能将你在一个领域中学习的技能转用到另一个领域：你可以学习 Rust 来编写 Web 应用，然后将同样的技能应用到你的 Raspberry Pi（树莓派）上。

<!--
This book fully embraces the potential of Rust to empower its users. It’s a
friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your
knowledge of Rust, but also your reach and confidence as a programmer in
general. So dive in, get ready to learn—and welcome to the Rust community!
-->
